# TeamP-Project

This is Universopoly of Calgary, a variant of Monopoly by Team OP.

To use this program, first clone the repository to your local machine. Then import the project in Eclipse using your preferred method, and run the Main class. You will see a text prompt asking for a text-based or graphical-based UI. Enter 1 for the former and 2 for the latter. The game will start once you choose.
